# spline_interpolation
My scripts written from my research into spline interpolation and the uses for it in different applications. So far I have applied this to robotics in the form of Cardinal Hermite Spline for 2D motion profiling.There are however various different Spline types such as B-splines, NURB splines, Bezier splines and of course Hermite splines. 
I wanted to do in-depth research of the mathematics behind these spline interpolations and write my own scripts and algorithms using them to both experiment with spline polynomials and the uses of these sorts of algorithms.
